Kytos-ng (Kytos next generation) is a fork of
[Kytos project](https://github.com/kytos), created to continue the development
of Kytos after the original project was shutdown.
Its main purpose is to be the main controller of
[Amlight](https://amlight.net), but we will keep things as generic as
possible so it can be used by anyone.
