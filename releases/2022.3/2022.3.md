Kytos-ng[^1] version `2022.3` was released in December

## Objectives

This version had these major objectives:

- `mef_eline` should be able to create EVCs with constrained paths and service level prioritization
- Specify how INT will be integrated and supported via NoviFlow experimenter actions
- `maintenance` should stabilize its v1 API and integrate with MongoDB 
- Support NoviFlow switches on end-to-end tests
- End-to-end tests should have fewer false positives and support retries
- `flow_stats` should stabilize its v1 API
- Drop support for OpenFlow 1.0
- Support REST endpoints user authentication with MongoDB
- Upgrade Kytos-ng core dependencies to leverage upstream fixes, enhancements and be able to leverage more asyncio functionalities
- All Kytos-ng NApps should have at least 85% of unit test coverage

In order to achieve the objectives of this version, the following enhancements were refined and delivered:

### 1. `mef_eline` should be able to create EVCs with constrained paths

`mef_eline` now supports EVC creation with path constraints that can be applied to a dynamic primary path or secondary dynamic failover paths. The following link metadata contrainsts can be used if they're configured: `bandwidth`, `utilization`, `priority`, `reliability`, `delay` and `ownership`. In addition other path attributes such as total accumulated cost, desired links and undesired links are also supported. The parameters are documented on [mef_eline OpenAPI specification](https://kytos-ng.github.io/api/mef_eline.html#operation/create_circuit).

In addition, `mef_eline` provides service level prioritization to allow EVCs to be handled based on their descending `service_level` value during convergence and consistency checks.

### 2. Specify how INT will be integrated and supported via NoviFlow experimenter actions

A blueprint has been specified for adding support to `telemetry` in Kytos-ng [EP031](https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos/blob/master/docs/blueprints/EP031.rst), which will be responsible for enabling INT on EVCs. NoviFlow switches will be supported via experimenter actions that been implemented by the `noviflow` NApp, and the functionality will be optionally enabled when an EVC is being created. The `telemetry` NApp is expected to be available in the `2023.1` release.

### 3. `maintenance` stabilization v1 API and integrate with MongoDB 

**TODO** fill out what will be feasible to be delivered, ask David to update this paragraph

### 4. Support NoviFlow switches on end-to-end tests

NoviFlow switches are now supported on [kytos-end-to-end-tests](https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos-end-to-end-tests/) as a target on pre-defined [testing topologies](https://github.com/amlight/kytos-end-to-end-tests/blob/feature/noviswitch/tests/helpers.py). Currently, NoviFlow switches are managed via SSH using `paramiko` and this integration was designed to be seamless with Mininet, NoviFlow switches are handled as a Mininet `Switch` so you can reuse or write new end-to-end tests. The NoviFlow Mininet integration will keep evolving during the next release as part of the Kytos-ng CI/CD pipeline.

### 5. end-to-end tests should have fewer false positives and support retries

end-to-end tests were enhanced to avoid performing assertions when network convergence can still be taking place, minimizing false positives asserts that could happen. Also, `pytest-rerunfailures` was introduced to help out renunning tests, that way providing additional evidence facilitating to identify and isolate underlying issues.

### 6. `flow_stats` stabilization v1 API

`flow_stats` has had its API reviewed and augmented consolidating its v1 API. `flow_stats` has simplified its code and responsibilities. Also, [a Zabbix integration script](https://github.com/kytos-ng/flow_stats/tree/master/scripts) is available and it's making use of this new v1 API and other NApps endpoints to monitor certain resources on Zabbix.

### 7. Drop support for OpenFlow 1.0

OpenFlow 1.0 is no longer supported on Kytos-ng NApps. It turns out that network operators who use Kytos-ng are comfortable having OpenFlow 1.3 as the supported version, also since OpenFlow 1.3 is a super set of OpenFlow 1.0 that allowed our team to simplify and remove old code to improve code maintainability and test coverage.

### 8. Support REST endpoints user authentication with MongoDB

The `@authenticated` REST decorator now uses a `users` MongoDB collection instead of an workspace of the deprecated storehouse. User creation is still performed either via `kytosd` cli, and or via the console.

### 9. Upgrade Kytos-ng core dependencies 

Kytos-ng core dependencies have been upgraded to the latest stable compatible versions to leverage upstream fixes, enhancements and be able to leverage more asyncio functionalities:

```
ipython==8.1.1
flask-socketio==5.2.0
flask_cors==3.0.10
flask[async]==2.1.3
janus==1.0.0
jinja2==3.1.2
watchdog==2.1.9
pyjwt==2.4.0
pylint==2.15.0
```
Flask/Werkzeug 2.0.0+ now provide ``async`` support, so NApps can leverage ``asyncio`` and its ecosystem when applicable using the same ``rest`` decorator.

### 10. All Kytos-ng NApps should have at least 85% of unit test coverage

`flow_stats` unit test code coverage has increased to 85%, now all Kytos-ng NApps have at least 85% of unit test coverage. For more information, please visit [Kytos-ng Tests Analytics Dashboard](https://kytos-tests.amlight.net/index.html).
