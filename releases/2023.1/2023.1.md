Kytos-ng[^1] version `2023.1` was released in July 2023.

## Objectives

This version had these major objectives:


- Augment `mef_eline` to support `"untagged"` and `"any"` VLAN UNIs when provisioning EVCs
- Introduce `of_multi_table` NApp responsible for managing a multi-table OpenFlow pipeline
- Evolve `flow_stats` into `kytos_stats` to support multi-table stats
- Improve and stabilize `maintenance` NApp functionalities
- Migrate `@rest` decorated routes from `werkzeug/flask` to `uvicorn/starlette`
- Stabilize `sdntrace_cp` and general improvements
- General UI fixes and enhancements
- Specify requirements for `mef_eline` VLAN range feature and new Kytos-ng documentation
- General core enhancements and endpoints OpenAPI validations
- Upgrade and simplify core development dependencies

In order to achieve the objectives of this version, the following enhancements were refined and delivered:

### 1. Augment `mef_eline` to support `"untagged"` and `"any"` VLAN UNIs when provisioning EVCs

`mef_eline` now supports provisioning EVCs with `"untagged"` and `"any"` VLAN UNIs. `"untagged"` will match any packet that doesn't have a VLAN header, whereas `"any"` will match any VLAN. `mef_eline` also supports asymmetric VLAN configurations on each UNI. If you need more information about the supported configuration combinations, there's a spreadsheet on [`mef_eline` PR 258](https://github.com/kytos-ng/mef_eline/pull/258) that documents the combinations for both intra and inter EVCs and which OpenFlow matches and actions will be performed.

### 2. Introduce `of_multi_table` NApp responsible for managing a multi-table OpenFlow pipeline

A new NApp [`of_multi_table`](https://github.com/kytos-ng/of_multi_table) has been developed to allow network operators to leverage OpenFlow multi-tables when that's beneficial for their network use case. `of_multi_table` is responsible for managing a multi-table OpenFlow pipeline. This NApp allows you to specify an OpenFlow pipeline composed of multiple tables, where you can also associate which table each NApp of the `kytos-ng` org should be pushing their flows. `of_multi_table` has been integrated with `mef_eline`, `of_lldp`, and `coloring`. Each NApp that pushes flows has a concept of `"table_group"`, which represents a set of flows with similar match criteria that is grouped in a particular table.

### 3. Evolve `flow_stats` into `kytos_stats` to support multi-table stats

In addition to supporting a multi-table OpenFlow pipeline on version `2023.1`, another new NApp [`kytos_stats`](https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos_stats) has been developed, which is responsible for providing multi-table statistics. `kytos_stats` is a successor of `flow_stats`. It also supports the same functionalities that `flow_stats` supports, except that `flow_stats` route prefixes were renamed. On version `2023.1` you can still use both if you're using `flow_stats` and still need the same API routes. In the future, `flow_stats` will no longer be maintained by Kytos-ng team, so you should plan to migrate to `kytos_stats`.


### 4. Improve and stabilize `maintenance` NApp functionalities

`maintenance` is now capable of generating a logical interruption on all device types (switches, links, and interfaces) properly expressing all affected devices. For more about how logical interruptions work you can check out [blueprint EP037](https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos/blob/master/docs/blueprints/EP037.rst#ep037---interruption-management). Whenever a maintenance window is scheduled, it'll transitively include associated devices, for instance, if you were to schedule a maintenance window on a switch, it would include all of its links and interfaces. In addition, `maintenance` has enhanced API validations.

### 5. Migrate `@rest` decorated routes from `werkzeug/flask` to `uvicorn/starlette`

Kytos-ng core has replaced `werkzeug/flag` with `uvicorn/starlette` that way enhancing and solving the following problems:

- `werkzeug 2.1.X` is no longer maintaining support to shutdown `werkzeug` server, which was pivotal for Kytos-ng to ensure a graceful shutdown since it's being embedded in the same process.
- Although `flask-socketio` server default threading mode is very reliable and works well out of the box for many use cases, it's vulnerable to threads scalability issues.
- A relatively high-rate of requests, e.g., 500 requests/sec, over 1 minute could lead to overall runtime instability.

`uvicorn/starlette` solves all of these problems while also being optimally designed to be used with `asyncio` and providing a higher capacity to serve requests. If you're upgrading to `2023.1`, the `@rest` decorator is now supposed to take a `request: kytos.core.rest_api.Request` return a `kytos.core.rest_api.JSONResponse` instance, all of the NApps from `kytos-ng` endpoints have been refactored accordingly for `2023.1`, their API specs are still the same.

If you're using a NApp that's not from the `kytos-ng` org and it has `@rest` decorated routes, it needs to be refactored accordingly to be compatible with version `2023.1`. In terms of performance and overall technical requirements, you can find [more information about it on this Kytos-ng GitHub discussion](https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos/discussions/337). `uvicorn/starlette` also unlocks native Python websockets, which in future versions can expose new types of bidirectional transport. `socket.io` dependency has been removed.

### 6. Stabilize `sdntrace_cp` and general improvements

`sdntrace_cp` is now officially considered stable. All of its API routes are versioned as v1, including supporting OpenAPI validations. Also, `sdntrace_cp` has augmented new states when performing a trace to facilitate understanding an outcome of a trace. In addition, `sdntrace_cp` has removed support to schedule traces to simplify code maintainability.

### 7. General UI fixes and enhancements 

On version `2023.1`, the following UI components were fixed:

- `mef_eline` now supports `primary_constraints` and `secondary_constraints`, including correctly clearing these components
- `ui` no logger supports `socket.io`
- `ui` topology map now displays `metadata.node_name` as a default value when it's defined

### 8. General core enhancements and endpoints OpenAPI validations

Kytos-ng core `GenericEntity` has been augmented to expose `status` and `status_reason`, which as a result is exposed on `topology` too. `status` represents the entity status, and `status_reason` is a set of string values that gives further information about why an entity isn't UP, which also minimizes overuse of `metadata` key value pairs in certain cases.

Kytos-ng core now exposes `@validate_openapi` decorator and an `async` function `avalidate_openapi_request(spec, request)` to validate API endpoints based an OpenAPI specification. On version `2023.1`, the following NApps are now validating their endpoints based on OpenAPI:

- `sdntrace_cp`
- `pathfinder`
- `of_multi_table`
- `mef_eline` (included validations on additional endpoints)

### 9. Specify requirements for `mef_eline` VLAN range feature and consolidated Kytos-ng documentation

On version `2023.1`, Kytos-ng team has initially [specified requirements for supporting a range of VLANs](https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos/issues/318) on `mef_eline` EVCs. Also, Kytos-ng team has specified [requirements to consolidate Kytos-ng documentation](https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos/discussions/342), which will simplify and facilitate to onboard new users and contributors. Both of these specifications will be prioritized and implemented in a future release.

### 10. Upgrade and simplify core development dependencies

Kytos-ng now ships these extra runtime dependencies:

- [`httpx`](https://github.com/encode/httpx)
- [`openapi-core`](https://github.com/python-openapi/openapi-core)

Also, Kytos-ng now provides the following development dependencies, that can be installed with `pip3.9 -e git+https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos.git#egg=kytos[dev]`, allowing NApps to reuse these common development dependencies, which simplifies development requirements updates across all `kytos-ng` repositories:

```

```

## Database data model changes

- `flow_manager`'s `flows` compound index `switch_1_flow.cookie_1_state_1_inserted_at_1_updated_at_1` has changed. If you're upgrading to `2023.1` from a previous version, you should run the [`drop_compound_index.py` script](https://github.com/kytos-ng/flow_manager/tree/master/scripts#drop-compound-index) to drop it, just so it can be recreated when `flow_manager` loads up again. Also, If you tried to upgrade to `2022.3.2` before and it ended up creating `'flow.priority_1'` index, then you also want to delete it by running `CMD=drop_index INDEX_NAME=flow.priority_1 python3 drop_compound_index.py`.

- `flow_manager`'s `flows` documents have been augmented with two new fields `table_group` and `owner`. If you're upgrading from version `2022.3` and you're going to use `of_multi_table`, then you need to preset these two fields on the `flows` DB collection. In order to do it, you can follow [`these instructions to use the pipeline_related.py`](https://github.com/kytos-ng/flow_manager/tree/master/scripts#add-owner-and-table_group-fields-to-flows-collections) DB script.

- `topology`'s `switches` and `links` collections will no longer store the `active` state and certain links metadata fields. If you're upgrading, it's recommended that you run the [`unset_active.py script`](https://github.com/kytos-ng/topology/tree/master/scripts#-unset-active-from-db-switches-and-links-collections-) to unset the DB fields that will no longer be used. Although, if you don't run this script, an upgrade from `topology` to `2023.1` (with the NApps that it depends on) will still work.
