Kytos-ng[^1] version `2023.2` was released in February 2024.

## Objectives

This version had these major objectives:

- Augment `mef_eline` to support vlan ranges
- Develop `telemetry_int` NApp
- Augment `pathfinder` filters to be able to exclude metadata `ownership` values
- Allow more granular configuration for event buffers queue size
- `mef_eline` general enhancements
- UI components for `pathfinder`,`sdntrace_cp`, and `mef_eline`
- Migrate core UI and NApps UI to Vue.js 3
- `flow_stats` in favor of `kytos_stats`

### 1. Augment `mef_eline` to support vlan ranges

`mef_eline` EVPL now supports symmetric vlan ranges. This feature enables a set of vlans to be encapsulated in a single EVPL, which also tries to efficiently minimizes the number of flow entries on both ingress and engress switches with vlan masks.

### 2. Develop `telemetry_int` NApp

A new NApp [`telemetry_int`](https://github.com/kytos-ng/telemetry_int) has been developed. This NApp is responsible for enabling In-Band Network Telemetry (INT) on EVCs. On this first iteration, INT can be enabled or disabled on EVCs, when INT is enabled, `telemetry_int` will provision higher priority flows matching TCP and UDP packets. For more information, check out [EP031 blueprint](https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos/blob/master/docs/blueprints/EP031.rst). On this iteration, `telemetry_int` hasn't implemented network convergence events yet, which will be released in the next version.

### 3. Augment `pathfinder` filters to be able to exclude metadata `ownership` values

`pathfinder` now supports a `not_ownership` filter, which will logically exclude accordingly the given `ownership` values. `mef_eline` has also been augmented to support setting this `not_ownership` filter on both primary and secondary constraints.

### 4. Allow more granular configuration for event buffers queue size

On `kytos.conf` these new options are supported:

- `api_concurrency_limit` for setting the maximum number of concurrent API requests on synchronous `@rest` endpoints before rejecting requests.
- `event_buffer_conf` for setting each `KytosEventBuffer` queue size for fine tuning. Prior to this version, each bounded queue size was derived from the `thread_pool_max_workers` linearly, but now queue sizes can be configured separated from the number of the thread pool workers. By default, each `KytosEventBuffer` queue size will be twice as the size of the number of the thread pool workers of a related thread pool.
- `thread_pool_queue_monitors` and `event_buffer_monitors` are for monitoring high queue usage of thread pools and `KytosEventBuffer`s respectively, by default, queue monitors are enabled and they will start logging a warning if any of the monitored queues are with 100% utilization over a time window of 5 seconds, which are configurable. Queue monitors coupled with APM can provide enhanced visibility for detecting queueing overload.

If upgrading from prior Kytos-ng versions, one might want to regenerate `kytos.conf` file to have all the default values explicitly set.

### 5. `mef_eline` general enhancements

The following significant enhancements and fixes have been shipped on this version:

- The `active` state now persists in the database, this has simplified EVCs activations that used to happen during `kytosd` restart.
- The disjoint algorithm now also excludes sharing switches when selecting the `failover_path`.
- Fixed race condition on `failover_path` when handling simultaneous link down events.
- EVC `active` status now include UNIs status.
- Fixed validation when trying to reusing the same UNI vlan when updating an EVC.

### 6. UI components for `pathfinder`,`sdntrace_cp`, and `mef_eline`

`mef_eline` vlan ranges `[[int, int]]` is also avaiable in the UI:

</div>
<div align="center">

</div>

Also, in the core interface component one can find information about the current ranges of vlans and which ranges are still available to use:

</div>

`sdntrace_cp` has new UI components supporting the current v1 API:

</div>

`pathfinder` now also interpolates certain reserved metadata values:

</div>


### 7. Migrate core UI and NApps UI to Vue.js 3

A new effort to migrate core UI to Vue.js 3 has been started, most major blockers have been addressed. In a next version, the migration to Vue 3 will be executed.

### 8. `flow_stats` in favor of `kytos_stats`

[`flow_stats`](https://github.com/kytos-ng/flow_stats) NApp has been deprecated in favor of [kytos_stats](https://github.com/kytos-ng/kytos_stats). `kytos_stats` is `flow_stats`'s successor, all `flow_stats` functionalities are still available and exposed on API endpoints but with a different route prefix, check out the [API docs](https://kytos-ng.github.io/api/kytos_stats.html) for more information.

## Database data model changes

If upgrading from `2023.1` the follow mandatory scripts need to be executed. In the `scripts` folder there's a `README.md` file with more information about each script:

[`topology` mandatory scripts](https://github.com/kytos-ng/topology/tree/master/scripts) for the `interface_details` collection:

- `scripts/vlan_pool.py` to update `available_tags` and set `tag_ranges`.
- `scripts/special_vlan_allocation.py` to set `special_available_tags` and `special_tags`.

[`mef_eline` mandatory scripts](https://github.com/kytos-ng/mef_eline/tree/master/scripts) for the `evcs` collection:

- `scripts/vlan_type_string.py` to update `tag_type` from integer to string.

`mef_eline` optional scripts:

- `scripts/redeploy_evpls_same_vlans.py` can be used to redeploy symmetric (same UNI vlans) EVPLs. `set_vlan` action is only set if UNI A vlan and UNI Z vlan are different now.


## Kytos-ng and NApps released
